//alert string was simple to use, this seems to work on the html
alert("You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:");

//added text to be clear on the vault combination
// 10 - 40 - 39
//used subtraction,multiplcation, and division with in each variables
const x = 15 - 5;
const y = 2 * 20;
const z = 78 / 2;

const combination = x + " - " + y + " - " + z
//created each alert to come up each combination; also combined them all at the end just for fun
alert(x);
alert(y);
alert(z);
alert(combination);



// not sure why i'm adding the console logs, just trying things out - i do realize this is not part of what will show up in html nor the alert box in html
// only shows up on console within inspect element in html
console.log(x);
// expected output: 10 on html console
console.log(y);
// expected output: 40 on html console
console.log(z);
// expected output: 39 on html console
